* Getting yourself organized with Orgmode

** Concept: Headlines - Outline mode

Every headline starts with one or more * 

Visibility of the headline hierarchy:
- Local visibility cycling with =<TAB>=
- Global visibility cycling with =S-<TAB>=

Increase or decrease level with =S-M RIGHT= or =S-M LEFT=

Move up/down within a level with =S-M UP= or =S-M DOWN=

Move a headline under another top level headline:
Cursor on the headline and then =C-c C-w=


** Concept: ToDo keywords
Default is TODO and DONE 

Cycling through them with =S RIGHT= or =S LEFT=

More keywords can be defined with a line =#+SEQ_TODO=:
- Items left of | are TODO items
- Items right of | are DONE items

Activate line with =C-c C-c=

Get a menu of all keywords: =C-c C-t=

** Concept: Schedule, deadline and agenda view
Scheduling is done with =C-c C-s=

Deadlines are defined with =C-c C-d=

Switch to agenda view with =C-a a=

Follow mode with =S-F=

Move forward with =f= or backward with =b=
